# Incognito Google Search
 Go Incognito is a convenient and user-friendly Google extension that streamlines the process of searching in incognito mode. With Go Incognito, users can easily search the web in incognito mode without the need to manually open a new incognito window, navigate to Google, and enter their search terms.  The extension adds a button to the user's browser that, when clicked, opens a small popup window with a text field for entering search terms. The user can then enter their search query and click the "Go Incognito" button, which immediately opens the search results in an incognito window.  This extension is perfect for users who value their privacy and want to avoid leaving a search history. It's also great for users who frequently switch between regular and incognito browsing and want a more efficient way to do so. Additionally, it also provides users with an option to use the extension for other search engines as well.  Overall, Go Incognito is a simple and effective tool for anyone looking to enhance their browsing experience and protect their privacy while searching the web.
